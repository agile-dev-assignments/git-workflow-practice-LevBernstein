[Bitcoin Could Push Global Emissions Above 2 Degrees Celsius, Scientists Say](https://truthout.org/articles/bitcoin-could-push-global-emissions-above-2-degrees-celsius-scientists-say/)

## Why this article:

As software developers, it's easy to view our work through rose-tinted glasses.
We make the world more connected, we open up new routes of financial transaction to make people less reliant on centralized money systems.
That being said, even the noblest of projects costs electricity. Some of the time, that electricity might be obtained from renwable sources; far more often, it is not.
Bitcoin took off so rapidly, which, combined with its decentralized nature and, therefore, a lack of oversight, has meant that the ramifications of this technology are only now being explored.
One of those ramifications looks to be an increase in global temperatures due to the huge energy needs of Bitcoin mining, especially in regions like Xinjiang that are reliant on fossil fuels.
